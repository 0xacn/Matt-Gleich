# 👋🏼 About Me

👋🏼 Hello! Ever since I was a little kid I've always been looking to make things, especially when it can help someone or bring someone joy. In January 2019 I started programming on my FIRST robotics team, @Team-501-The-PowerKnights as a computer vision programmer. Since then I have been fascinated with programming, trying to learn as much as possible. Besides programming I enjoy 📷 photography, 🚵🏼‍♂️ riding my bike, 🚶🏼‍♂️ hiking, and hanging out with friends.

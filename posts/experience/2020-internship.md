# üíº 2020 Internship

_Written Friday, August 14th, 2020_

Today is my last day at Bottomline Technologies as an intern on the Cloud Automation team. Throughout the experience, I got to meet some really talented people and work on some really cool stuff. Although the experience was remote I was still able to make connections with the other interns' thanks to the amazing work put by Bottomline to support the intern program.

## ‚ú® What I worked on

### ü¶ä GitLab

As Bottomline Technologies switches to GitLab for their code storage I helped set up a bunch of its infrastructure. I accomplished this with tools such as `Puppet` and `Grafana`.

### ü§ù Innersource

Utilizing the large amount of open-source experience that I have I was able to help develop an innersource contribution model for all of Bottomline. Truly my favorite thing I got to work on this summer.

### üöÄ Open-source

As part of an innovation challenge a few other interns and I put together an interesting presentation on what open source at Bottomline could look like.

### ü§ñ Release Automation

I worked on a release automation program for Bottomline that allows my manager to create PR release tables way faster while dropping dependencies like Microsoft access.

## ‚õ∫Ô∏è Remote internship survival guide

Because this internship was remote there are a bunch of things I learned along the way that helped me. First of all, you most likely are going to be using a VDI (Virtual Desktop Interface) and it probably going to be running windows. In that case here are some tips for you:

### ‚úçÔ∏è Write locally, copy into VDI

Because the VDI can be very slow at times writing the program or text on your actual computer and then pasting it into the VDI is generally faster. Before you do this make sure that you can paste the text into your VDI!

### üñ• Two monitors

If you can get one a second monitor is a game-changer. Because the VDI is so slow having a second window where you can write your program or search the web is a must-have.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Have a fast internet connection

Because you are connecting to the VDI over the internet a fast internet connection is something that makes the experience of using a VDI way better.

### üîê Password manager

As part of your internship, you will probably have a bunch of passwords you have to manage. Because of this using a password manager like LastPass is a huge time saver and is the most secure option out there.
